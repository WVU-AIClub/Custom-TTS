You know, what am I supposed to do? What do you want? You know, are we gonna go out? Is that what you're trying to, why are you leaping around there, throwing those things all up and going over there on my face? Huh? What do you want, Lindsay? Tell me what you want! Well, I'll tell you what you want. You want nothing! You want nothing! All right, because we all know that no woman anywhere wants to have sex with anyone and to titlate us with any thoughts otherwise is just bogus. I'm sorry, I can't see what you're going for here. Let me look.
